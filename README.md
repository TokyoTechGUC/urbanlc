The official implementation of **Annual Past-Present Land Cover Classification from Landsat using Deep Learning for Urban Agglomerations** (2024).

**UrbanLC** is a Python library for land cover classification (LCC) from Landsat Images. It features pretrained deep learning models, which are compatible with all Landsat sensors up-to-date: MSS, TM, and OLI-TIRS. 
<!-- Documentation is availiable here. -->

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/sincostanx/UrbanLC.git
```

Our library downloads Landsat images and other satellite data from [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) (GEE) using the official ```earthengine-api```. Please refer to this [installation guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install) when setup your environment.

## Getting Started

We provide tutorials for researchers and practitioners in ```tutorials/```, including downloading Landsat data from GEE and inferring their land cover maps. Weights for our pre-trained LCC model will be automatically downloaded depending on the type of sensor you use. For convenience, we also provide link for downloading directly here as well:
